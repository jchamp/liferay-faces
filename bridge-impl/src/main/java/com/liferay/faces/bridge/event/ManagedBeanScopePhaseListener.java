/**
 * <p>According to the JSF 2.0 JavaDocs for {@link ExternalContext.getApplicationMap}, before a managed-bean is removed
 * from the map, any public no-argument void return methods annotated with javax.annotation.PreDestroy must be called
 * first. This would be equally true of any custom JSF 2.0 scope, such as the bridgeRequestScope. This class is a JSF
 * PhaseListener that listens after the RENDER_RESPONSE phase completes. Its purpose is to force the managed-beans in
 * bridgeRequestScope and requestScope to go out-of-scope which will in turn cause any annotated PreDestroy methods to
 * be called.</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that this functionality is implemented as a PhaseListener because I couldn't get it to work after the
 * lifecycle terminated. My suspicion is that Mojarra has some servlet dependency stuff going on. Specifically,
 * Mojarra's WebappLifecycleListener might be getting invoked or something. The strange thing is that it appears that
 * Mojarra makes managed-beans go away, but not by calling the map.clear() or map.remove() methods. Mojarra apparently
 * handles things with a listener that captures ServletContext attribute events, which may also be playing a role.
 * Anyway, doing this with a PhaseListener seems to work.</p>
